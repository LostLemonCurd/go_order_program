# Working Title
This program allows you to create clients, products and orders, view them and export them to a csv file if needed. 
For each order, a pdf file is created and ideally would be sent via email to the customer. 

The database schemas are available under the folder database_schema and to connect to the correct db, you can head on to the dbFunctions.go file and change the credentials as you wish.
